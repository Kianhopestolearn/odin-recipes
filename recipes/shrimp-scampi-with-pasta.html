    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>So you ate the last one, Now lookin for more? well I have to disappoint you mate, this one doesnt help much either...</p>
    <p>We don't want to forget what happened with the one before, Do we? </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large (2 pound) fresh lobster</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lobster and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until bright red.</li>
        <li>As soon as the lobster starts cooking, melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Cook and stir just to release the liquid. Do not let them brown.</li>
        <li>When the lobster comes out of the pot, place it on a cutting board and use a big knife to cut it in half lengthwise. Place the halves meaty side down into the skillet with the onion and garlic. Cook for about 3 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Bring another pot of water to a boil and season with a little salt. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8 minutes, or until tender. If you want to save time and a pot, you could boil the pasta in the lobster water since it is already boiling, just add salt.
